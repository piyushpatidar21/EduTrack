EduTrack is a web-based application designed to help teachers monitor and predict student academic performance using machine learning. Teachers can create classes, add students and subjects, and input nine comprehensive academic metrics for each student including attendance, marks, assignments, study hours, extracurricular activities, projects, certifications, and internships. The application uses these metrics to automatically predict student grades and assess risk levels (Low, Medium, High), allowing teachers to identify struggling students early and provide timely intervention. Students can log into their own dashboard to view their predicted grades, understand their risk level, and receive personalized recommendations for improvement. Teachers can also access detailed analytics with visualizations showing class performance patterns and download comprehensive reports in PDF format. The entire system is built with Streamlit for the interface, SQLite for data storage, and scikit-learn for the machine learning model, making it a complete solution for data-driven educational decision-making.
